== Class info

- Time: Friday  9:50am-12:15pm
- Location: International Phase 1 (ÂõΩÈôÖ‰∏ÄÊúü) C405A

 
This introductory course gives an overview of many concepts, techniques, and algorithms in machine learning, from linear models such as logistic regression and SVM to more advanced topics such as deep neural networks and reinforcement learning. The course will give the student the basic ideas and intuition behind modern machine learning methods as well as a formal understanding of how, why, and when they work. The underlying theme in the course is statistical inference as it provides the foundation for most of the methods covered.

*Prerequisites*: Undergraduate level calculus, probability and linear algebra. Basic Python programming.
